# 📸 OLDOGRAM – Social Post Feed

This is **Project 4** in my Scrimba Full Stack Career Path. It’s a mini social media feed app inspired by Instagram, built with a focus on **semantic HTML**, **accessible development**, and **essential responsive CSS**.

> ⚠️ I built this project **entirely by myself from scratch**, without help from anyone. All the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code is my own work.
